# ICPC-Columbia-9-25-2022
My code for the ICPC Coding Competition hosted by Columbia. 
I worked on problems A - 98 Percent Fail!; B - Boundary Wave and Fail, C- REDOUT, F - Danmaku Paranoia, I - The Dark Blowhole, J - Three Spheres and a Tetrahedron
The codeforces competition accpeted my solutions to A and J, with Time exceeded on C, F, and I. I believe my code functions but I need to optimize my methods and data strucutres.
